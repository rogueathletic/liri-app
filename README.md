<strong>liri.js Node App</strong>
<h1>UCSD Full Stack Coding Bootcamp</h1> 
<h2>MY10 Liri App</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilizing several diferent types of api keys the challenge was to format all 3 to work together in a single program format. 
<br>
The First objective was to structure the content in away that allowed me to format each individdual sector of the app in a way that it could be modified as a single entity. To do this I enacted multiple methods. The first was to seperate the program sectors to their own pages.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><h1>Program Files</h1></li>
    <li>.gitignore</li>
    <li>index.html</li>
    <li>keys.js</li>
    <li>liri.js</li>
    <li>log.txt</li>
    <li>package lock-json</li>
    <li>Package.json</li>
    <li>Random.txt</li>
    <li>Readme.md</li>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <li><h1>API Files</h1></li>
  <li>Bandsintown.js</li>
  <li>OMDB.js</li>
  <li>searchSpotify.js</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><h1>Omitted files</h1></li>
  <li>.env</li>
  <li>Node_Modules</li>
  <li>.DS_store</li>
</ul>

<p>As it sounds the app is loosly structured as a alt for #siri from @apple. The program takes in a serries of 4 optional commands utilizing three seperate api calls. Each option consists of a specific serries of key words to enact the apps features:
<ul>
  <li>Bands in town | concert-this</li>
  <li>Spotify| Sspotify-this-song</li>
  <li>OMDB | movie-this</li>
  <li>wild card | do-what-i-say</li>
</ul>

<p>
Bandsintown is a music website, billed as a "platform where artists and fans connect". The site allows users to receive notifications about tours and bands playing in the userâ€™s area. It also has tools for artists to manage tour dates.
  <br>
  For this page you will see in the image below the required commands ar elisted at the top of the p[age above all other lines of code. From there we move into the primary function of the segmet of the app to listen for the information listed on lirl.js, to take that infrmation and send a get request via AXIOS API to return content pertaining to the request. This request is called as followes. 
  
 ```node liri.js concert-this [band name]```

<p>In the image below you will see a zoomed in version of the existing Bands in town code. This portion of the code allows us to not only record the errors and findings to log.txt; but, it allows us to provide a value if te users input is undefined.</p>
