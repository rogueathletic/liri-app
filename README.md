<strong>liri.js Node App</strong>
<h1>UCSD Full Stack Coding Bootcamp</h1> 
<h2>MY10 Liri App</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilizing several diferent types of api keys the challenge was to format all 3 to work together in a single program format. 
<br>
The First objective was to structure the content in away that allowed me to format each individdual sector of the app in a way that it could be modified as a single entity. To do this I enacted multiple methods. The first was to seperate the program sectors to their own pages.

<ul>
  <li>liri.js | Root file for this app</li>
    <li>.env | storage for the Spotify API Key</li>
    <li>Keys.js | transferable file constructed to segway API keys form .env to the applicable location needed</li>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>.</li>
